    <h1>The King of the Jungle</h1>
    <p>
            The lion (Panthera leo) is a species 
            in the family Felidae; 
            it is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, 
            rounded head, 
            a reduced neck and round ears, and a 
            hairy tuft at the end of its tail. 
            It is sexually dimorphic; male lions 
            have a prominent mane, which is the most 
            recognisable feature of the species. With a 
            typical head-to-body length of 184–208 cm (72–82 in) 
            they are larger than females at 160–184 cm (63–72 in). 
            It is a social species, forming groups called prides. 
            A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females 
            and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, 
            preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and 
            keystone predator, although some lions scavenge when 
            opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, 
            although the species typically does not.
